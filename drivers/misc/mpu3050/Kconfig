config MPU_SENSORS_MPU3050
    bool "MPU3050"
    depends on I2C && MACH_LGE_P2
    help
      If you say yes here you get support for the MPU3050 Gyroscope driver
      This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
      will be called mpu3050.

config MPU_SENSORS_KXTF9
    bool "Kionix KXTF9"
    depends on MPU_SENSORS_MPU3050
    help
      This enables support for the Kionix KXFT9 accelerometer

config MPU_SENSORS_AMI30X
    bool "Aichi Steel ami30X"
    depends on MPU_SENSORS_MPU3050
    help
      This enables support for the Aichi Steel ami304/ami305 compass

config MPU_SENSORS_TIMERIRQ
    tristate "Timer IRQ"
    depends on MACH_LGE_P2
    help
      If you say yes here you get access to the timerirq device handle which
      can be used to select on.  This can be used instead of IRQ's, sleeping,
      or timer threads.  Reading from this device returns the same type of
      information as reading from the MPU and slave IRQ's.

config MPU_SENSORS_DEBUG
    bool "MPU debug"
    depends on MPU_SENSORS_MPU3050 || MPU_SENSORS_MPU6000 || MPU_SENSORS_TIMERIRQ
    help
      If you say yes here you get extra debug messages from the MPU3050
      and other slave sensors.
